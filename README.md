### ASIC-Interactive-Proof
This repo provides a Rust implementation of the CMT interactive protocol due to Canetti, Garay, and Thaler (http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-642-40084-1_5).

The code also illustrates what NOT to do when writing Rust code (namely trying to use OOP principles to design Rust software).
